    <h1>Console Fix test</h1>
    <p>
        To see this test work, a console should be open. To turn the logs on and off for this page, click the following link:
    </p>
    <p id="link"></p>
    <script>
        var link = window.debug ? "consoleFix.html" : "consoleFix.html?debug=true";
        var txt = window.debug ? "Hide Logs" : "Show Logs";
        document.getElementById("link").innerHTML = '<a href="'+link+'">'+txt+'</a>';
    </script>
    <p>
        Console Fix is designed to do two things:
        <ol>
            <li>
                <strong>Fix the IE 8 Console.</strong>
                It sucks. It doesn't put spaces between arguments so they all run together.
                But worse, when you refresh the page it doesn't clear the console. This is not just inconvenient.
                If there are too many logs in the IE console, it will slow to a crawl and sometimes crash.
                consoleFix addresses both of these problems.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Allow for the console to be turned off in all browsers.</strong>
                It's common in development to accidentally leave console statements in your code,
                deploy to production, and then find that it doesn't work on someone else's computer who doesn't have
                Firebug installed. By including consoleFix.js the console is turned off by default.
                To turn it on, simply include debug=true in a script before the consoleFix.js script, or add debug=true in the page URL.

            </li>
        </ol>
    </p>
